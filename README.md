# SC1015_Mini_Project
## About 
This is a mini project for SC1015 (Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on maximizing REM sleep. 

REM sleep is the most important phase of the sleep cycle because it plays an important role in dreaming, memory, emotional processing, and healthy brain development. Therefore, REM sleep can be a primary indicator of whether an indivdual is properly rested when he is asleep.

We as university students are constantly bombarded with assignments and never ending work. With such a fast paced work environment, we often neglect our own mental and physical health by comprimising on sleep. However, at times it is impractical and near impossible to not lose a little bit of sleep in order to meet deadlines. Therefore, our group would like to dive deeper into the factors that affect our quality of sleep and how to get the most out of our sleep. 

## Problem Definition
How can we maximise our REM sleep?

## Dataset
Our mini project uses the Sleep Efficiency Dataset from Kaggle:

[Sleep Efficiency Dataset]https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency

## Libraries/Algorithms
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Code
Collaboration was done on Google colaboratory, written in Python. 

Our code shows our raw data set, cleaned data set, exploratory data analysis, regression models and findings from our project.

## Learning outcomes
- How to choose correct values to fill in NaN values in dataset
- How to curate our dataset to clearly and concisely present the relevant information, and thereafter easier data manipulation by us
- Ridge regression from sklearn
- Random forest regression from sklearn
